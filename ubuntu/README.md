# ubuntu-install
A repository with all the initial tools I need upon installing a new ubuntu machine

## What has to be done manually
1. Open Tweaks and configure hidden ubuntu options
2. setup workspace keyboard shortcuts
3. install [linux surface book kernel](https://github.com/jakeday/linux-surface)
